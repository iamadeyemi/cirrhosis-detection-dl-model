# 🧠 DL Model for Early Cirrhosis Detection and Survival Impact

## 🔬 Overview

Early detection of liver cirrhosis is crucial for improving patient survival and quality of life. This project bridges **deep learning** and **medical diagnostics** by developing a powerful AI model capable of detecting early signs of cirrhosis in high-risk individuals using clinical data and machine learning classifiers.

By blending cutting-edge AI with a strong foundation in clinical insight, this work aims to accelerate detection, enhance precision, and support decision-making in liver disease diagnosis.
